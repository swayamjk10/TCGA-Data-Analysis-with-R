# TCGA-Data-Analysis-with-R
This repository provides a complete pipeline to download, process, and analyze datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using R. Leveraging the capabilities of powerful R packages, this project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from genomic data


This repository offers a comprehensive pipeline for downloading, processing, and analyzing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using R. Harnessing the power of advanced R packages, the project focuses on uncovering valuable insights from genomic data through:

**Transcriptome Profiling**
**DNA Methylation Analysis**
**Mutation Visualization and Summary**
Tailored for bioinformatics researchers, this project exemplifies best practices for managing and analyzing large-scale cancer genomics datasets effectively.

**This repository demonstrates a comprehensive pipeline for downloading, processing, and analyzing TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) datasets using R. With the help of powerful R packages such as `TCGAbiolinks`, `maftools`, and `pheatmap`, this project provides insights into gene expression, DNA methylation, and mutation data.**

## Features üåü
**Transcriptome Profiling:** Extract and preprocess RNA-Seq data for TCGA-BRCA (Breast Cancer).
**DNA Methylation Analysis:** Visualize methylation beta values for TCGA-LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma).
**Mutation Analysis:** Summarize and visualize mutation data for TCGA-BRCA.
**Interactive Heatmaps:** Generate heatmaps for highly variant methylation probes.
**Oncoplots:** Create mutation oncoplots to highlight significant genomic changes.

## Key Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
R Packages:
`TCGAbiolinks` for querying and downloading TCGA data
`maftools` for mutation analysis and visualization
`pheatmap` for heatmap generation
`SummarizedExperiment` for managing genomic data
**Visualization:** Heatmaps, mutation summaries, and oncoprints.

## üåü Features
